# QuranTextDiff

Various forums/blogs quote many Quranic verses, and in doing so some unintentional mistakes might crop up, or even worse
could happen when someone tries to tamper the Quranic texts by forgery. What this web application does (or better *will
do* when it is complete!) is check Quranic quotes in any web page for its correctness by comparing against an authentic
version in the backend.

This is my project for my Undergraduate final year. I am doing this in django, and principal workhorse of this application
is python's [difflib](http://docs.python.org/3.5/library/difflib.html#module-difflib) library.

Suggestions/advices are highly solicited!
